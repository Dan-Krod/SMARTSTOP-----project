## Prototype 2:Advanced Obstacle Detection & Adaptive Braking System   

SMARTSTOP is an evolving safety system designed to enhance electric scooter riding security through **real-time obstacle detection, adaptive alerts, and automated braking mechanisms**. This second prototype integrates **ultrasonic distance sensors, obstacle detection sensors, vibration feedback**, and a **servo-controlled braking system** to provide improved rider awareness and reaction times.

### Features:
- **Multi-Level Distance Alerts:** Detects obstacles at different safety thresholds (Warning, Danger, Critical).
- **Visual & Audible Indicators:** **LEDs** indicate current safety levels, while a **buzzer** delivers warnings.
- **Vibration Motor Feedback:** Adds haptic alerts for immediate rider awareness.
- **Servo-Controlled Braking:** Automatically adjusts braking mechanisms based on the proximity of obstacles.
- **LCD Display:** Shows real-time distance measurements to keep the rider informed.

### System Behavior:
- **Safe Movement:** Green LED activated, no immediate threats.
- **Obstacle Detected (Warning Distance):** Yellow LED, vibration alert, and light buzzer warning.
- **Obstacle Detected (Danger Distance):** Red LED, stronger buzzer alert, and **partial braking activation**.
- **Obstacle Detected (Critical Distance):** Red LED flashing, **servo brake fully engaged**, continuous buzzer alarm.

### Next Steps:  
This is the second prototype of SMARTSTOP. Future iterations will focus on **automated notifications** and **speed-controlling mechanisms** to further enhance rider safety and system efficiency.
