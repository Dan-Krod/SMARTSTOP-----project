## üöÄ Project Overview  

SMARTSTOP is designed to improve rider safety through **real-time obstacle detection, adaptive braking, and speed control mechanisms**. The prototypes gradually integrate new technologies to ensure optimal safety and efficiency.

### **Prototype Evolution**
1. **First Prototype** ‚Äì Focuses on **obstacle detection** using ultrasonic sensors, providing visual and audible alerts to riders.
2. **Second Prototype** ‚Äì Introduces **adaptive braking**, combining obstacle detection with **servo-based braking assistance**.
3. **Third Prototype** ‚Äì Implements **automated speed control**, integrating **multi-sensor detection**, smart braking, and obstacle response.

Future iterations will enhance **automated notifications** and **AI-powered decision-making**.
