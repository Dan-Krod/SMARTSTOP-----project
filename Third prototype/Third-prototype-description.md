## Prototype 3: Advanced Speed Control and Obstacle Response  

SMARTSTOP continues to evolve with this third prototype, integrating **multi-sensor obstacle detection, adaptive speed control, and automated braking mechanisms**. This iteration introduces **three ultrasonic distance sensors**, **servo-assisted braking**, and **real-time motor speed adjustments** to enhance rider safety.

### Features:
- **Triple-Sensor Detection:** Three ultrasonic sensors provide **enhanced obstacle awareness** for front and side detection.
- **Adaptive Speed Control:** A **potentiometer-based system** dynamically adjusts motor speed based on distance readings.
- **Automated Braking:** **Servo-controlled braking** ensures **gradual slow-down** or **immediate stop** depending on obstacle proximity.
- **Visual & Audible Feedback:** LCD provides **real-time distance readings**, while a buzzer delivers warnings.
- **Manual System Toggle:** A button allows the rider to **enable or disable** the safety system.

### System Behavior:
- **Safe Movement:** No obstacles detected, motor runs freely at user-defined speed.
- **Obstacle Detected (Front, Side):** System automatically adjusts **braking strength**, displays warning on LCD, and activates **audible alerts**.
- **Critical Distance Breach:** Immediate motor stop, servo brake engaged, buzzer alarm for rider attention.

### Next Steps:  
This is the third prototype of SMARTSTOP. Future iterations will focus on **automated notifications** and **speed-controlling mechanisms** to further enhance rider safety and system efficiency.
