## Prototype 1:- Basic Obstacle Detection & Alert System

SMARTSTOP is an innovative system designed to improve the safety of electric scooter riders through real-time obstacle detection and alerts. This prototype integrates **ultrasonic distance sensors** and **obstacle detection sensors** to assess the proximity of nearby objects. When an obstacle is detected, the system provides immediate feedback to the rider via **LED indicators**, an **audible buzzer alert**, and an **LCD display showing the distance to the object**.

### Features:
- **Obstacle Detection:** Uses an analog sensor to identify obstacles within the scooter's path.
- **Distance Measurement:** Ultrasonic sensor calculates proximity to potential hazards.
- **Visual & Audible Alerts:** LEDs indicate safe (green) or dangerous (red) situations, while a buzzer provides an alert sound when necessary.
- **LCD Display:** Shows real-time distance readings, keeping the rider informed.

### System Behavior:
- **Safe Movement:** Green LED activated, reassuring the rider of a clear path.
- **Obstacle Detected (Safe Distance):** Distance displayed, short buzzer alert.
- **Obstacle Detected (Critical Distance):** Red LED activated, warning message displayed, continuous buzzer alarm.

### Next Steps:
This is the first prototype of SMARTSTOP. Future iterations will focus on **adaptive braking** and **automated notifications**.
